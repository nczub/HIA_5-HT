# HIA_5-HT
QSPR models for HIA prediction of compounds with serotonergic activity.

We developed regression and classification models with mljar tool (https://github.com/mljar/mljar-supervised).
There are available on this repository.

In folder datasets, we share databases used as trening and test set for models' creation.

Results of this research was published:
